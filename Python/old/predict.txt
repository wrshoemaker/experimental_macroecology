# remove zeros from observations
for each species, calculate
 tf = mean(count/totreads)
 tvpf = mean( (count^2 - count)/totreads^2 ) )

totreads refers to the total number of reads for all sites with non-zero read counts of the given species

for each species

f = o*tf
vf = o*tvpf
vf = vf - f^2


## PREDICT OCCUPANCY ASSUMING A GAMMA AFD
calculate gamma params for each species
  beta = f^2/vf
  theta = f/beta
  o_pred = 1- mean((1.+theta*totreads)^(-beta ) )
